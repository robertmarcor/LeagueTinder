# LeagueTinder

I’m building a Tinder‑style swipe app but with a League of Legends twist. It’s a small side project for my React Native course to experiment.

## What you’ll do in the app

- Swipe through LoL‑themed profiles (think champions, roles, vibes)
- Like or pass; when there’s a match, you get a playful “It’s a match!” moment

## Notes

- Unofficial, just for learning. League of Legends assets belong to Riot Games, Inc.
